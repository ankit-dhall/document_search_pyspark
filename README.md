## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a search engine using PySpark on Hadoop.

It portrays a high-level functionality and an interesting use-case of PySpark to use TF-IDF to index an entire dataset and perform a search given a query.

This particular project utilizes Spark RDD's as well as specialized Spark functions that can be leveraged to perform high-performance distributed computing.

## Data Description

The dataset used, is a collection of over 100,000 documents structured into a JSON file with each document containing textual data spanning varying lengths.

The dataset used can be can be referred here [shakespeare_full.json](https://github.com/ankit-dhall/document_search_pyspark/blob/main/shakespeare_full.json)

## Technical Overview

The project has been divided into various steps which include:
* Data Exploration and Pre-Processing
* Indexing Dataset using TF-IDF
* Performing Search to Retrieve Top Documents using TF-IDF Scores
* Writing a Spark Job File to perform Search using Hadoop File Environment
